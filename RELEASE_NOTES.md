# 🚀 ELDA-Net v1.0.0 – Initial Public Release

## Overview
**ELDA-Net (Edge-Lightweight Detection and Adaptation Network)** is a real-time, resource-efficient lane detection framework tailored for Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving applications. It integrates a modified U-Net architecture with adaptive lane estimation techniques, offering a balanced trade-off between accuracy and computational demand, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano.

## 🔧 Features
- ⚡ **Lightweight Architecture** based on U-Net for fast inference on embedded platforms  
- 🧠 **Adaptive Lane Estimation** for robust tracking of occluded, faded, or missing lane markers  
- 🎥 **Video Inference Support** with semantic segmentation overlay  
- 📊 **Comprehensive Evaluation** on TuSimple and CULane datasets  
- 🧪 **Modular Design** for easy experimentation and extension
